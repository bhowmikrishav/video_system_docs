# Jovial Video System

Jovial Video System is a ***Multi bitrate video processing & streaming system***.
This project is dedicated to building a fast, reliable and easy to scale system.

To achieve the above we are implementing:-

- ***Distributed micro-services architecture*** 

- ***Masterless NoSQL database ("Cassandra")*** for throughput intensive data

- ***Hardware failure resistant design***

- ***Shraded MongoDB database*** for high scalability, availability & required ACID-compliant model.
<i>Since, MongoDB ensures Atomic transaction to the level of a single document which is enough for the requirements in this project.</i>

## Components of this system

### User Management System [>](./UMS/)

### Minimal UI

### File Store System [>](./fss/)

### Remote Processing demon

### Data server
