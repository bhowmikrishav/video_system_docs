# FFMPEG
It is a free and open-source platform consisting of a vast
software suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other
multimedia files and streams. 
> At its core is the **FFmpeg** program itself,
designed for command-line-based processing of video and audio files, and
widely used for format transcoding, basic editing, video scaling, video post-
production effects, and standards compliance.

It supports almost all [audio/video codecs](h264, h265, vp8, vp9, aac, opus, etc.) and [file formats](mp4, flv, mkv, ts, webm, mp3 etc.). Moreover it supports again all [streaming protocols](http, rtmp, rtsp, hls, etc.).

### Example -
For instance To convert a flv file to mp4:
>  ffmpeg -i input.flv output.mp4
